I attend UCSD as a Computer Science major. I use this GitHub profile to manage school projects, which are private for Academic Integrity reasons.

I started out as a transfer who had familiarity with programming languages Java and C. My UCSD projects and assignments has made me become familar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SystemVerilog, Python (inclduing Pandas) and C++. 

I am also currently setting up some older projects to showcase my data structures and algorithms skillset. I do have plans to add new functions to these projects and improve them with the new programming abilities I gained while attending UCSD.

In the meantime, operating systems is making me lose my hair.
