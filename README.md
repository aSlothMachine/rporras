My name is Richie and I attend UCSD as a Computer Science major. I use this GitHub profile to manage school projects, which are private for Academic Integrity reasons. I am also currently setting up some older projects to showcase. I do have plans to add new functions to these projects and improve them with the new skillsets I gained while attending UCSD. In the meantime, operating systems is making me lose my hair.
